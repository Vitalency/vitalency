    <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

    <p>
      The Vitalency website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your
      online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard
      disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
      deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you,
      and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie
      to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature
      to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that
      you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize
      Vitalency pages, or register with Vitalency site or services, a cookie
      helps Vitalency to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
      This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such
      as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to
      the same Vitalency website, the information you previously provided can be
      retrieved, so you can easily use the Vitalency features that you
      customized.
    </p>

    <p>
      You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
      automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
      setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
      cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features
      of the Vitalency services or websites you visit.
